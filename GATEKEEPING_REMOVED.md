âœ… Gatekeeping removed from src/index.js

The checkWallet() function has been removed from the main entry point.

Now try running the wizard again:
npm run wizard

If you still get the 'ARB ready' message, it might be cached or coming from a different source.

You can also try:
1. Clear any npm cache: npm cache clean --force
2. Restart your terminal
3. Try: node src/index.js directly

The main gatekeeping code has been successfully removed!
